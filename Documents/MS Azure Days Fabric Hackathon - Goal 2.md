Transform Your Ingested Data for Analytics 2 hours

Once your data is in Fabric, you’ve got plenty of options to shape it into something useful. Pick whichever approach fits your workflow or the challenge you’re tackling.

You can:

    • Use a notebook to clean, prep, or enrich your data
    • Build a workflow to automate transformations
    • Write SQL to transform data directly in your lakehouse
    • Create views to simplify or structure your datasets
    • …and more

Fabric gives you the flexibility to transform data however you prefer.

Check out the notes below for more details on what each Fabric feature can do.





Notes:

1) Transform with Dataflows (Visual / No-Code)
Description: Use Dataflow Gen2 to visually prepare and transform data using Power Query before landing it into your Lakehouse or curated tables. It’s great for filtering, joins, type changes, and light cleansing at scale.

2) Transform with Notebooks (Code-Driven)
Description: Use Microsoft Fabric Notebooks (Spark Python/SQL) to clean, enrich, and reshape your data after ingestion. Notebooks give you full control with code and are ideal for complex transformations and machine learning preparation.

 5) Transform using SQL Queries
Description: Once data is stored in your Lakehouse, a SQL analytics endpoint lets you run familiar T-SQL queries to aggregate, filter, and prepare data for analytics or BI workloads.

 6) Create SQL Views for Analytics
Description: In Fabric you can define SQL views over your transformed data to simplify query logic or expose curated datasets for BI tools or users. (Community examples and best practices)
